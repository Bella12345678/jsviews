# JsViews
JsViews is a preview of work for interactive data-driven views, based on integration between jQuery Templates and jQuery Data Link. The included jquery.tmpl2.js is work-in-progress towards the next preview version of jQuery Templates. jquery.views.js is a preview of JsViews, which is based on (but considerably revised) jQuery Data Link, and which integrates data linking with templated rendering.
