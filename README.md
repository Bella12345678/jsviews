# JsViews
JsViews is a preview of work for interactive data-driven views, based on integration between jQuery Templates and jQuery Data Link. 

Requires jquery.render.js (optimized version of jQuery Templates, for rendering to string). See JsRender at [http://github.com/BorisMoore/jsrender](http://github.com/BorisMoore/jsrender).
